kfxmpp hacking guide
--------------------

general guidelines
------------------
* kfxmpp code aims to be clean and readable.
* each function, global variable etc. MUST be documented with Doxygen
  (including all parameters, return values etc)
* above that, normal comments are also welcome

code style
----------
* indents are done with tabs
* no newline before opening brackets (with exception for functions)
* type names are capitalized
* function names are lowercase, words separated with underscore
* macros, enumerations etc. are in uppercase, words separated by underscore
* public symbols are prefixed with 'kfxmpp' (+ see 3 above rules)
* all other symbols are declared static
* some sample:

/**
 * \brief Do something
 * \param foo A foo object
 * \param bar A bar factor
 * \return A very sophisticated factor
 **/
int kfxmpp_foo_do_something (KfxmppFoo *foo, int bar)
{
	int ret = very_sophisticated_function (bar);
	if (ret < 0) {
		/* Something is going wrong */
	}
	return ret;
}
